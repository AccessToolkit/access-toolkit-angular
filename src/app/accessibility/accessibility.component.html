        This site was made with accessibility in mind and with the intention
        that everyone should be able to use it. The site should meet the Web
        Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA, however it is
        possible that issues and barriers to use were missed as we are a small
        team with limited resources. There are also accessibility and usability
        features that are missing from the site that we have listed below.

            but this may cause issues for users. See

        User testing beyond simply meeting guidelines is a vital part of making
        a website accessible. However, this has been beyond the scope of this
        small project. If there is any part of this website that remains
        inaccessible for you, please
