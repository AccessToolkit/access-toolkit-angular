      <p>
        This section will cover how to create a more accessible workplace. To
        create accessible programmes and workspaces, it is important to take
        stock of your own access needs and those of all workers. There is little
        point in having an accessible programme when the workers producing those
        programmes don’t have their own access needs met or work in an
        inaccessible workplace, facing risks to health, safety and wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a balance to strike here, as access work requires additional
        labour that often falls on disabled staff or is taken on by disability
        led organisations. In this section, there will be examples of policies
        on how to balance the access needs of staff against the programme and
        create a more accessible workplace.
      </p>

          ><span>Reasonable Adjustments and Access Check-In’s</span></a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first step is to have a conversation with all workers about their
        access needs, and make a plan agreed by both parties on how to make the
        workplace accessible. The reasonable adjustments process was detailed in
        the Planning section, and is where a manager should then make a plan of
        how to accommodate access needs including adaptations to the workplace,
        access equipment and software, flexible working hours or the ability to
        work from home.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a legal requirement, the reasonable adjustment process should be part
        of an overall culture of discussing access openly. This can be supported
        by managers holding access check-ins during 1:1’s and quarterly reviews
        with staff. Access needs often fluctuate and change over time, and the
        adjustments and the workers needs will change with that. The reasonable
        adjustments process should therefore only be the beginning of the access
        conversation, which is left open throughout the workers time at an
        organisation.

      <p>
        Often the first step to creating a more accessible workplace is
        implementing flexible working and working from home policies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Flexible working often allows workers to make decisions about where
          and how they work. This can include flexible or compressed hours,
          part-time, working from home or job sharing. Disabled people often
          have healthcare commitments, care of others or need to work to
          different schedules as part of their access needs and know best for
          themselves how to manage their job and disability. As with access
          needs, flexible working should be worker centred and may change over
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Special leave is another effective policy in centering access, health
          and wellbeing in the workplace. Current sick leave provision is not
          adequate for most workers and workplaces, as most require additional
          days leave for various reasons. This could be structured or
          implemented for different circumstances such as, additional sick,
          mental health, gender transition, rest, caring, parental, pregnancy
          loss, menopause and grief leave. In terms of mental health leave, it
          is advised that a number of days are allocated per worker per year
          that can be taken with short notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some workers may need to take extensive periods of time off for
          healthcare or a flare up of their condition. It is vital that the
          worker is supported in taking leave and plans are made to support them
          if they decide to return, without judgement.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Pay, conditions and worker solidarity are essential to creating
        accessible workplaces for disabled people.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Joining a union can provide the official support needed to advocate
          for workers and disability rights in the workplace, before or during a
          legal breach.
        </li>
        <li>
          Permanent contracts with good conditions provide the stability that
          all workers require, especially disabled workers who have to plan
          long-term healthcare commitments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Disabled people often face higher costs of living then non-disabled
          people, paying for equipment, care and accessible housing. Pay and
          remuneration should be commensurate with these costs.

        Workplaces can often be inaccessible in how much work is expected of
        workers, the pace of production schedules and the lack of support staff.
        In creating more accessible workplaces, there are a number of policies
        that can be implemented to make work more manageable and accessible.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Slow production, including longer production schedules, extended
          deadlines and flexible outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hire support workers for staff who are eligible under Access to Work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shorter and less regular meetings. Keep meetings to 30mins - 45mins
          maximum, with breaks and only have meetings when necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Re-assess workloads and job descriptions; if a role is inaccessible
          for someone, changes can be made or responsibilities moved around.
        </li>

      <p>
        An effective way of creating an accessible workplace is hiring a
        representative workforce, including disabled people of diverse lived
        experiences. Disabled people face numerous barriers in accessing work,
        which can be addressed through a number of recruitment policies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Have a disability friendly workplace that implements and promotes
          accessible policies such as flexible working, working from home,
          accessibility support, union membership support and manageable
          workloads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guarantee all disabled applicants who meet the minimum job description
          requirements are interviewed, in line with the Disability Confident
          Scheme.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make applications accessible which include easy read, audio, BSL/ISL
          and large print versions on accessible websites. Applicants should be
          able to submit alternative application versions such as BSL/ISL, audio
          or video. An email and phone number should be provided for applicants
          to contact if they require support.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold accessible interviews where applicants can be joined by a support
          worker, a sign language interpreter, a scribe or given additional
          time, or have questions in text or sent in advance.
